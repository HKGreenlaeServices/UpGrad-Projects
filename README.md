You are working for the telecom company ‘Firm X’. It has a customer base set across the
country. In a city ‘Y’, which is a significant revenue base for the company, due to heavy
marketing and promotion schemes by other companies, your company is losing customers i.e.
the customers are churning. Whether a customer will churn or not will depend on data from
the following three buckets:
A. Demographic Information

The data are provided in three separate data files given at the end of the page. The aim is to

affecting the churn.
